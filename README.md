Snowind is a set of tools for Vuejs 3 and Tailwindcss to help create a design system. It is composed
of a Tailwindcss plugin and some Vuejs 3 components

- **Consistent design system**: the widgets rely on a default high level customizable set of colors
- **Dark mode support**: dark mode is fully supported out of the box
